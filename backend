# routes are defined paths that determine how requests to a specific URL should be handled by the server. These routes link URLs to specific handlers, typically functions or controllers, that process the request and return a response.
For example, in a Node.js/Express backend, you define routes to handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different resources like users, products, orders, etc.
1. GET:
    1.Used to retrieve data from the server.
    2.Typically employed for read-only operations.
    3.Commonly used for fetching resources.
2. POST:
    1.Used to create new resources on the server.
    2.Requests typically include a payload in the request body.
    3.Commonly used for submitting data to be processed or stored.
3. PUT:
    1.Used to update existing resources on the server.
    2.Typically requires the client to send the complete resource representation.
    3.Commonly used for updating existing records.
4. PATCH:
    1.Similar to PUT but used to apply partial modifications to a resource.
    2.Allows clients to specify only the changes to be made.
    3.Commonly used for making partial updates to resources.
5. DELETE:
    1.Used to remove resources from the server.
    2.Commonly used for deleting resources.
